			In 2022, the Census’ <a href= "https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html"> Household Pulse Survey</a> began including in their monthly survey questions about COVID and Long COVID, or COVID symptoms that last more than three months. 
		</p>	
		<p>	

			The newly released data, reflecting responses up to September 2024, shows that people with disabilities are consistently more likely to face Long COVID symptoms than non-disabled people.
		</p>	
		<p>	
			Valerie Bai, a Family Nurse Practitioner at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia, said, “People with disabilities like chronic illnesses have compromised immune systems, which increases the likelihood of Long COVID.” 
		</p>	
		<p>
			COVID infections also continue to rise among all adults in the United States: in June 2022 40% of adults reported ever having had COVID; by September 2024 nearly 62% of adults reported having had the virus.
		</p>	
		<p>
			Despite the ongoing spread, the CDC relaxed its <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0301-respiratory-virus.html">  COVID recommendations</a> in March 2024, treating it more like the flu or a common cold.
